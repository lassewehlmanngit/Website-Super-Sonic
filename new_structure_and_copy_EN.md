Website

1. Hero Section (The Hook)
Option A:
* Headline: You need a website that works. Not a rocket plan with unpredictable costs.
* Sub-headline: Many website builders assume you've been a web designer for five years. And agencies? They sell you unnecessary options at unfair prices, just to lock you into expensive subscriptions. We do things differently: Websites that do exactly what you need. Maximum 14-day delivery, 100% ownership, and a fixed price. Because the mid-market deserves better.
* CTA: Get your free mockup in 72h


2. Social Proof I (The "Big Player" Experience)
* Logos as names: Volkswagen, Allianz, Novartum, SinnerSchrader, Sparkasse, BLVRD, MakroSolutions, NEVARIS
* Caption: The mid-market deserves better than old websites that don't work


3. The Website Builder Trap (Real Talk)
Headline: Agencies promise...

Text:
"Let's be honest: A website builder promises you freedom, but it gives you work. You sit at your computer in the evening, pushing pixels around, and in the end it still doesn't look good on mobile.
We don't deliver a DIY kit. We deliver the finished, polished result. We take the chaos out of the equation so you can focus on your business. You're a CEO, not a hobby web designer."


4. The "Anti-Bloat" Promise
Text before headline: Agencies want to sell you more than you need. Website builders are confusing and require developer skills. Both give you monthly costs you don't even want. 
Headline: We only build what you need. Text:
"A dead blog that no one has read since 2022? Gone. Animations that only eat up your loading time? You don't need them. We reduce your website to what matters: inquiries and trust. Every feature on your site has a job. If it serves no purpose, we don't implement it."


5. Comparison: Us vs. "Old School" Agencies
Feature	Traditional Agency	Your "Sonic" Website
Costs	€10k - €20k (variable)	€5,600 (fixed price)
Monthly rent	€150+	€0 - €7
Maintenance costs	€5,000 per year	€0
Duration	3-6 months	14 days (Guaranteed)
Ownership	Platform locked, no ownership, agency lock-in	100% your code, The website belongs to you, no maintenance needed.


6. The "Sonic Engine" (Engineering Story)
Headline: 4 years. 56 iterations. Text:
"We don't start from zero. Your website is based on a framework that we've optimized 56 times over four years. Every line of code is tuned for speed, security, SEO, and AI-Search."


7. CEO Letter (Personal & Direct)
Headline: A word from Lasse: Why we started Super Sonic. Content:
"Hey, I'm Lasse.
After 10 years of software development, marketing, and website design for brands like VW, Allianz, Novartum, and more, I had enough of sluggish processes and overpriced agency invoices that just want money without giving anything back. I wanted to build something honest.
We founded Super Sonic to give the mid-market true digital sovereignty. It's time for the mid-market to become digitally discoverable and modern. We deliver you a website that belongs to you, that's fast and looks damn good. No buzzword bingo."


8. The Team (The Makers)
Headline: No outsourcing. No radio silence. Text:
"Behind Super Sonic is a dedicated team of developers, marketers, and support staff. We communicate as equals and work without friction. If you have questions, you reach us directly. Even after your website launches, we're here for your questions."


9. Case Studies (Examples)

Headline: We developed 6 successful projects for clients before we even charged money.
Text: We didn't want to offer a service you couldn't trust. 
* Example 1: The fully booked trades business.
    * Problem: Website from 2005, not mobile-friendly.
    * Solution: Sonic Blueprint in 14 days.
    * Result: 45% more qualified inquiries through the new contact form in the first month.
* Example 2: The IT systems house.
    * Problem: WordPress chaos, 8-second loading time.
    * Solution: Migration to our Sonic Stack (Code Sovereignty).
    * Result: Loading time under 0.8s. Top rankings on Google for local keywords.


10. Take the Fear Away
Headline: What if something goes wrong? Text: Problems and errors are part of everyday life (and we all know that). We stand by our word and build you a website that works. If errors and problems arise, we solve them together.


11. Reference Projects (Examples)
* Project 'Logistics Hero': Modern design, focus on employee recruiting. (Caption: 'Application possible in 60 seconds.')
* Project 'Digital Law Firm': Professional, fast, GDPR-compliant. (Caption: '100% accessible according to BFSG.')


12. Process Video (The Demo)
Headline: Look over our shoulder. Content: (Embed a video here) "In 2 minutes, I'll show you how to get your free website. Free of charge. If you like it, we'll get started and begin your project."


13. Digital Sovereignty (Security)
Headline: It's time to call your website YOUR PROPERTY. Text:
"Your website doesn't sit in some closed US cloud. We use open-source power and modern hosting (e.g., Render). That means: Maximum security, full GDPR compliance, and monthly costs approaching zero. The mid-market is tired of paying thousands in monthly costs. We see it the same way."


14. Future-Proof (BFSG & AI-SEO)
Headline: Ready for 2026: When Google and AI read your website. Text:
"We optimize your code so that not only Google loves you, but also AI systems like ChatGPT can find your information. Plus: We build 100% accessible according to the new BFSG law."

15. 
Ever heard of schema, lazy-loading, and aria-label? You don't need to. Because we implement these for you. A modern website consists of more than text, color, and fonts (which many website builders want you to believe). But do you have questions about implementations and technologies we use or can integrate? No problem, write to us directly at [Email].


16. You can edit your website texts yourself. No dependency on us after your website goes live. We show you how in this video. - Explain and show Tina CMS.

14. The "Free First Look" (Form)
Headline: Test us before you book us. Sub-headline: Fill out the form briefly (takes 2 min). I'll send you a free design mockup within 48h. Text/explanation:
Spend €5,600 without knowing what you'll get? Not with us. If you're unsure, you can request a free concept to see if we're just talking or actually know our stuff.


15. Strategic FAQ
* Why so affordable? Because we've automated and optimized our process. SMBs want websites that work and showcase their service/product – discoverable online. We don't sell you rocket plans. That's why we're faster and better for the mid-market. 
* What if I want to change something? You have 14 days after launch for a 'Joker Request'. With this, you can request a change. You need a blog after all? No problem. Instead of green, you'd rather have blue? Consider it done. 
* Do I need to know how to code? Zero. If you can write an email, you can maintain your website. We also provide everything in a guide, with video, and walk you through it.



16. Final CTA (Scarcity)
Headline: We only take 3 projects per week. Text:
"To keep our 14-day promise, our capacity is limited.

One more thing: In exchange for getting such an awesome website, we'd like to ask if we can get your honest video testimonial after launch. So more SMBs can see that a new website doesn't have to be a pain in the ass." Button 1: Get your free website and see for yourself Button 2: Got 15 minutes and questions?
